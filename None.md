`None` is a special constant representing the absence of a value or a null value. It is a unique object and the sole instance of the `NoneType` data type.

#### Key characteristics and uses of None

- Representing Absence of Value: None is used to indicate that a variable does not currently hold any meaningful data, or that a function does not return a specific value.
- **Default Argument Values:** `None` is commonly used as a default value for function arguments, allowing the function to handle cases where an argument is not provided.

Note: `is` checks for the object identity.


None is considered falsey in a boolean context.
