VLM is an AI that understands and generated content by processing images or videos and text together.

## Key Components:

- Vision Encoder: Converts the images/videos into numerical representations.
- Language Model (LLM): Processes text and these visual embeddings together.
- Training: Trained on massive datasets of image-text pairs to align visual and textual concepts.

## Core Capabilities

- **Image Captioning:** Generating descriptive text for images.
- VQA: Answering questions about image content.
- Document Understanding: Extracting info charts, receipts etc.
- Object Detection/Segmentation: Identifying and locating objects.
- Multimodal Dialogue: Conversing using visual inputs.

### Example:
- E-Commerce: Generating product descriptions from photos.
- Healthcare: Summarizing medical images.
- Robotics: Following text instructions to interact with the environment (Vision-Language-Action Models)
- Accessibility: Describing visual content for visually impaired users.


# Object Detection/Segmentation

VLMs are increasingly being utilized for object detection and segmentation tasks.

- Natural Language Interaction: VLMs allow users to query images using Natural Language prompts.
- Zero-shot and Few-shot Learning: VLMs excel at identifying and segmenting objects they haven't explicitly been trained on. Valueable for rare objects or dynamic environments.
- Semantic Understanding: VLMs combine visual features with semantic information derived from text, leading to a deeper understanding of objects and their relationships within an image.
- Open-Vocabulary Capabilities: Unlike traditional models limited to a fixed set of classes.
